## Project links and descriptions

### [Python Bikeshare Project](https://github.com/terrytheng930/terrythengs_portfolio/blob/38684d0d119a65b23e814b1b814525b42ad2f26d/Bikeshare%20Project.ipynb)
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington. My goal was to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Additionally, I wrote a script that took in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

#### Satistics Computed
##### 1. Popular times of travel
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day
##### 2. Popular stations and trip
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end
##### 3. Trip duration
* total travel time
* average travel time
##### 4. User info
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC & Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC & Chicago)

In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
My goal was to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
Additionally, I wrote a script that took in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
I was excited to dive into this project and see what insights I could uncover about these three major cities and their bike share systems!
